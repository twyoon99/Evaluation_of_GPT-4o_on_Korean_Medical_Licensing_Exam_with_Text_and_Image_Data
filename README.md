# Korea Clinical Datathon 2024 
## Evaluating the performance of GPT-4o on Korean Medical Licensing Examinations using both text and image data (+ possible bias perpetuated in GPT-4o)
### Team Name : Bias, By us!
---


### Introduction
#### Background


  GPT-4o : Multimodal model has been introduced
  There are no studies evaluating the performance of LLM on KMLE yet. 
  There are no studies evaluating the Medical Licensing Examination using GPT-4o yet.
  Bias might be perpetuated in LLMs


#### Objectives
Evaluate GPT-4oâ€™s accuracy on the KMLE using both text and image data
Compare the accuracy between providing images and providing text only.
Evaluate possible bias perpetuated in GPT-4o
Evaluate the impact of different sex and race/ethnicity instructions on the performance of GPT-4o in generating responses to test questions
Evaluate accuracy across subjects
Evaluate different prompting strategies (ex. CoT vs no CoT)   (CoT: chain of thought prompting)
